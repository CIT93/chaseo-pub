It honestly helped me a lot because for the functions we were supposed to make on the Decision App I was lost on how to start that, but I am pretty sure I just use

<!-- const add2 = function(a) {
  return 2 + a;
}

const result = add2(3); -->

And just change up the add2 to the names that I use

This is called a default value

<!-- const add2 = function(...a) {
  return 2 + a[3];
}

const result = add2(1, 2, 3, 4); -->

I believe this is an "argument"?


<!-- const a = 3;

(function(){
  console.log("inside IIFE ")
})(); -->

This is how u do an "IIFE"

Must declare what u are passing into it for it to work correctly.
